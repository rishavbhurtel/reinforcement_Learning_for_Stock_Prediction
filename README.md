## Overview
It's implementation of Q-learning applied to (short-term) stock trading. The model uses n-day windows of closing prices to determine if the best action to take at a given time is to buy, sell or sit.

As a result of the short-term state representation, the model is not very good at making decisions over long-term trends, but is quite good at predicting peaks and troughs.

## Running the Code

To train the model, download a training and test csv files from [Yahoo! Finance](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) into `data/`
```
mkdir model
python train ^GSPC 10 1000
```

Then when training finishes (minimum 200 episodes for results):
```
python evaluate.py ^GSPC_2011 model_ep1000
```
